            <h2>To Discuss Farmers' Issue In Lok Sabha, Opposition Meets Over Strategy</h2>
            <p>Over 10 Opposition parties met for a strategy session for the Lok Sabha on Thursday, a day ahead of the proposed 15-hour debate on the farmers' issue in the Rajya Sabha. Earlier this week, the government had offered a 15-hour discussion. But the opposition objected after Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said the discussion will take place after the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.</p>
            <p>Most parties including the Shiv Sena, National Conference, the Left parties and the DMK were unanimous that given the current situation in the Delhi borders and the continuing agitation, a separate discussion must take place on the farmers' agitation issues and concerns. </p>
            <p>Congress's Rahul Gandhi was present throughout the meeting.
                    The opposition has refused to accept the demand for a joint, extended discussion on the Motion of Thanks, as it would not be correct especially since this is a current and important issue. </p>

            <h2>45% Of India's Healthcare Workers Vaccinated: Health Ministry</h2>
            <p>The government today expressed satisfaction at the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations as it gets closer to its targets. "We had estimated that we have about one crore healthcare workers. But when we registered them it was around 96 lakh (96,31,637). 43.9 lakh (43,91,826) have already been vaccinated as of 1.30 pm today, which means 45 per cent of India's total healthcare workers have been vaccinated. 
                This is satisfactory," Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.</p>
            <p>13 states have vaccinated more than 50 per cent of their healthcare workers, the top three states being Madhya Pradesh (73.6 per cent), Rajasthan (66.8 per cent) and Tripura (65.5 per cent).
                But some others have covered less than 30 per cent of their healthcare workers. Sikkim is at 29.9 per cent, Jammu and Kashmir at 23.2 per cent, Tamil Nadu at 23.7 per cent and Chandigarh at 22.6 per cent.</p>
            <p>"We are holding virtual conferences with these states and are advising them on how to improve the numbers," Rajesh Bhushan said...
                The government today claimed that it was involving the private sector too in vaccinations as over 1,200 (1,239) private hospitals were already carrying out vaccinations along with 5,912 government facilities. They also gave a clarification on questions about vaccine vials expiring.</p>
